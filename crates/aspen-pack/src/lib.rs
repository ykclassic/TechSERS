//! Pack handling for Aspen: push ingest, `.idx` v2, entry tables, object
//! scans, and the deduplicating stitcher.
//!
//! Every stored pack is **self-contained**, **base-first** and holds **no
//! object twice** ([`aspen_core::pack`]). This crate is where those
//! invariants are established and relied on:
//!
//! | Module | What it does | Plan reference |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`ingest`] | Pass 1 receive, thin-pack completion with the duplicate rerun, forward-base repair, the `.idx` and entry table | push path step 2 |
//! | [`scan`] | One traversal of a pack: commit rows (`commit_index`) and the objects it references but lacks (connectivity check) | push path step 2, S4 |
//! | [`stitch`] | Keep-first, single-pass stitching of stored packs for clients without packfile URIs | fetch path step 4, S1 |
//! | [`locate`] | `ObjectLocator` and `BasePrefetcher` over stored packs: cached `.idx` probes, delta chains read in parallel rounds | push path step 2, S3, S4 |
//! | [`graph`] | Every object's references by `.idx` position, and the reachability walk behind the per-write split | push path step 2, B1 |
//! | [`subset`] | Writes a pack holding a subset of a completed pack's entries (undeltifying deltas whose base is left out) plus extra full objects | push path, B1 per-write packs |
//! | [`repack`] | Writes one pack from several stored packs: keep-first union (or a kept subset), base-first, delta depth capped by undeltifying | compaction, C1; shallow packs, C8 |
//! | [`rewrite`] | Rewrites one stored pack base-first, for the `rewrite_pack` repair job, and verifies the result | fetch path step 4, S1 |
//! | [`shallow`] | The object set of an exact shallow pack: the wants, the region's commits and everything their trees reach | fetch path step 5, C8 |
//! | [`verify`] | Checks the three invariants on any pack file (ingest output, compaction output, stitched packs) | S1 item 6 |
//! | [`idx`], [`entries`], [`header`] | `.idx` v2 parse and write, the entry-table header walk, entry header codecs | |
//!
//! The crate depends only on `aspen-core` among Aspen crates; it reaches
//! storage only through the `aspen-core` traits ([`locate`]). Uploads and
//! metadata writes are the caller's (`aspen-server`, node B1). Everything
//! except [`locate`] is synchronous CPU and local-disk work; callers on an
//! async runtime run it on a blocking thread.
