//! The receive-pack service (node B1, `docs/PLAN.md` push path).

//!   5. object graph, connectivity           aspen-pack graph, ObjectLocator
//!   6. commit check per command             aspen-core CommitCheck + exact ancestry walk
//!   7. one pack per write                   aspen-pack subset (forced-trunk rule too)
//!   8. register, upload, commit with CAS    MetaStore::register_pack, BlobStore, MetaStore::commit_push
//!   9. report                               aspen-proto ReportStatus

//! The service holds no state between requests except caches of immutable
//! data (`.idx` files, ref versions) and the prefetch gate that bounds the
//! memory all concurrent pushes hold for delta bases.
//!
//! **Mirror mode** (node C4) hooks in through [`PushThrough`]: for a
//! repository in proxy mode, the accepted updates are forwarded to the
//! upstream between step 7 and step 8, and only what the upstream accepted
//! is committed; in async mode every write enqueues a `mirror_push` job in
//! its own transaction. Updates coming *from* the upstream enter through
//! [`ReceivePack::import`], which the hook never sees.
