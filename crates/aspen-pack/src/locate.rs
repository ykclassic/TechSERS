//! Finding objects in stored packs: the `ObjectLocator` and
//! `BasePrefetcher` contracts of `aspen_core::ingest`, implemented over any
//! `MetaStore` (for pack rows) and `BlobStore` (for `.idx` files and pack
//! entries).
//!
//! - **Location** probes each search pack's `.idx` (fanout, then binary
//!   search) in probe order and stops at the first hit (S3, "Base-object
//!   lookup"). `.idx` files are immutable, so they are cached in memory up to
//!   a byte budget; a warm lookup reads no object storage.
//! - **Cold start** (monorepo benchmark, item 8): concurrent misses on one
//!   pack share one load (single flight), so 128 pushes that start together
//!   read each `.idx` once, not 128 times. Whether a pack's `.idx` is kept
//!   whole or sampled depends on the search set, not only on its own size:
//!   in probe order, an `.idx` is kept whole only while the set's whole
//!   `.idx` files still fit [`LocateOptions::idx_cache_bytes`], and the rest
//!   are sampled. A repository whose indexes outgrow the cache then keeps
//!   all of them (part whole, part sampled) instead of evicting and
//!   reloading them on every push.
//! - **Prefetch** locates every candidate base, then reads its entry and its
//!   delta chain from the blob store. A pack whose `.idx` is kept whole is
//!   kept with its **chain map**, each entry's base from the pack's entry
//!   table, so every entry of every chain is known before anything is read
//!   and they are all read in one round of parallel range reads: a chain of
//!   depth 50 (what `git gc` and compaction write) costs one round trip,
//!   not 51 (monorepo benchmark, item 11). In a sampled pack
//!   (`crate::sampled`) chains are still found by reading: each round's
//!   reads reveal the next bases, so a chain of depth d costs d + 1 rounds
//!   there. Chains are then resolved locally and the full objects handed to
//!   completion as [`aspen_core::ingest::InMemoryBases`].
//! - **Lookups** in sampled packs read a window's IDs and offsets together
//!   (one round trip), and probe every sampled search pack at once, so a
//!   lookup costs one round trip however many large packs the repository
//!   has; probe order still decides which pack answers. With a local
//!   directory ([`StoredPacks::with_local_dir`]) the sample keeps a copy of
//!   the sections lookups read on local disk, written while it is built
//!   (`crate::sampled`), and a lookup sends no blob store request at all
//!   (node 12b: a push looks up every object it brings, and each lookup in a
//!   sampled `.idx` was two GETs).
//! - **Local disk** ([`StoredPacks::with_local_dir`]): beside each sampled
//!   `.idx` in the cache, its chain map (16 bytes per object) and its
//!   lookup sections (24 bytes per object), in unnamed files deleted when
//!   the sample leaves the cache.
//! - **Memory** of a prefetch is bounded by
//!   [`LocateOptions::max_prefetch_bytes`]: every inflated entry, every
//!   intermediate chain result and every output object is charged before it
//!   is allocated, and going over refuses the prefetch with
//!   [`PrefetchError::OverBudget`]. An intermediate result is kept only
//!   while another chain or candidate still needs it, and each object is
//!   moved, not copied, into the output when nothing else needs it, so one
//!   chain of depth d over objects of size S peaks near 2 S, not (d + 2) S.
//!
//! Every read is of a range inside a size the `packs` row states, so it
//! uses [`BlobStore::read_exact_range`]: a short read is
//! [`StoreError::Corrupt`].
